# repeatsProject
This is currently implemented to run manually. If by some stroke of luck (and I didn't add some horrible coding error into the plmc code), it is a successful repeats correction, I will make it easier to run.

For now, it is implemented for PF00023, the ankyrin protein family. 

To run, you make sure you have the PF00023 alignments from https://github.com/roespada/DCAforRpackage/blob/master/DCAforR/inst/PF00023_ncbi.txt (it all comes from this paper https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-015-0648-3)

Then you run the rPipelineRepeats.R and then the pyPipelineRepeats.ipynb and then my modified plmc code: https://github.com/ayshaw/plmc

I don't know if it will work but if it does its yours and my lucky day.
